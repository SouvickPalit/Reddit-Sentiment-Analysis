# Reddit-Sentiment-Analysis

The purpose of this project was to find out whether covid 19 was affecting the mood of people on social media by conducting sentiment analysis on the Reddit comments from the years 2017 to 2020.

The data was gathered using python and pushshift API and the analysis was conducted in R. You will find the csv files and the code used to gather, clean and analyze the data here.
